# TOP Javascript Course Project - Restaurant Page
02/17/2022 ~ 02/24/2022

## Objectives
Using webpack, create a simple restaurant site with the ability to tab between sections of the site.

- All HTML elements should be made via DOM manipulation

## Learnings

First time using webpack and setting up and configuring things was a little bit of a learning curve but I can see the huge appeal to using webpack to help have more maintanable code. Definitely would like to use webpack again for personal projects that may have a lot of moving parts.
